                			<p>I am currently a junior at Spanish Springs High School, I am enrolled in Journalism and Web design, and hope to have my certification in Adobe 		                            Dreamweaver by the 				end of this school year. Throughout the year I work on various small projects, I have created a few of my own sites, as well as creating                            sites for family memebers and friends. I also 				                enjoy using Javascript to create small apps for websites such as, price calculators and other                            small in browser testing features. During school, I maintain our schools Journalism 		                website that is based in Word Press, as well as creating                            scripts to better improve the sites functionality. All of my projects can be found in the footer of this page.</p>

                        <p>I plan to begin my college career at TMCC in the web development track, after finishing this course I would love to continue my enducation at the University of Nevada Reno 				                        also in this field or a similar track such as computer science. My overall goal is to get a job as an entry level front-end developer, as this is the area that stikes me as                        most interesting, but during this time I am                         very willing to expanding my knowlege into the back-end side of web development, witch I have began doing                        by creating my own ticket system.</p>
